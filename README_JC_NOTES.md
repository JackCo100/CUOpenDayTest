Requirements
- Adopt CU colour scheme and create a more visually appealing website
- Display information in a more user-friendly way
- Display more information from the data API, for example description of event


Further Ideas:
- More information in modals, i.e. location displayed on a map (e.g. using Leaflet)
- A 'my day' planner where user can select events they wish to attend and the website would then display the list of events selected in a chronological order, so that the user can plan their day.
