Requirements
- Adopt CU colour scheme and create a more visually appealing website
- Display information in a more user-friendly way
- Display more information from the data API, for example description of event


Further Ideas:
- More information in modals, i.e. location displayed on a map (e.g. using Leaflet)
- A 'my day' planner where user can select events they wish to attend and the website would then display the list of events selected in a chronological order, so that the user can plan their day.

The design of the website can still be improved, the content is there however it is still a little rough around the edges design wise - for example, the text in the modals is 'as-is' from the API and such lists are displayed inline but this could be updated to display as a formatted list, to improve readability.
